This project is incomplete...

I do not feel like I have retained enough knowledge to do so. There are a couple of reasons why that I think that is.

Firstly, the way my brain holds and discards knowledge. It usually just keeps stuff in on the short term. Usually so I can actually do assignments and get good grades within the short timeframe that the information is relevent, and then discarding it.
I have also realized that the best way that I do retain information is by going through and actually applying the information on the fly, in like class activities where what we learn is applied immmediatly, which somehow makes me remember it longer

The second possible reason could be the class being early in the morning and im kinda sorta half asleep during the class. Sure, I might look awake, but Im not completely there. Maybe picking on me would help keep me awake, or at the very least immersed in the classroom environment.

Regardless of which, I think I need tutoring with a programming tutor. I have to do required study tables at Eigehman hall due to me making a few trivial mistakes last semester so I have to have at least six hours being there working on something. If you could reccomend a tutor to me, or tutor me yourself, while I am doing these study table hours, I think it would be a very helpful towards my performance and understanding of programming.

If things are not going too well performance wise after the next assignment, I will drop the class and learn programming from another class. I will make sure not to make it a morning class as well, since that usually has a negative effect on my performance in whatever class it is.



In all honesty, game programming and some game design are the only reasons Im in college, and if I had it my way that would be all I would be learning. Too bad I have other classes I got to balance out too.

If you do not see this readme by this monday, I will instead tell you about the readme file.
